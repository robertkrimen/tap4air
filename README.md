# TAP-style testing for Adobe Flex/Flash/ActionScript

Existence of mm.cfg will prevent the test script from (tracing) to stderr

#### TODO

* Add command-line/environment option to "stderr" (trace) to stdout 
* As in the above, add an option to force stdout to stderr (not use
  "/dev/stdout")
* Add .bail
